Repository for Activity 9.1 and 9.2
# MIT PCDE Activity 9.1 and 9.2

This repository contains my submission for **Activity 9.1 and Activity 9.2** of the *MIT Professional Certificate in Data Engineering* program.

The notebook (`MIT.ipynb`) demonstrates foundational Python programming and data exploration concepts used in data engineering coursework, including:

- executing Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment  
- working with variables, data structures, and control flow  
- using Python libraries commonly used in data tasks  
- documenting code and outputs inline for reproducibility

## How to view or run this notebook

You can view the rendered notebook directly on GitHub by clicking on `MIT.ipynb`.

### To run the notebook locally
